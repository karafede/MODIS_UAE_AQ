# MODIS_UAE_AQ
## An ensemble of scripts to process satellite data from MODIS TERRA and AQUA (also MAIAC data) with the R software. 
## These algorithms generate operational maps from near-real time satellite data through the NASA website. The scripts are designed for Windows and LINUX environments. You can customize these scripts by changing the extension of your geographical area that are you going to choose starting from the shape files of your region.
